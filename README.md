## Technical Requirements
### Main Requirement: AI Implementation
Each project must include AI elements using Unreal Engine’s Behavior Tree and Blackboard systems. Here are a few examples of how AI can be implemented:

- **Enemy AI**: Create several enemy types with varying behaviors, such as patrolling, attacking, and defending.
- **NPC Routines**: Develop NPCs with idle walking routines, interaction triggers, or reaction systems.
- **Companion AI**: Implement a companion character that follows and assists the player, adapting to different scenarios.
- **Boss AI**: Design a complex AI for a boss character that changes tactics based on the player's actions.

### Gameplay Length

The game should be designed to offer a **vertical slice** experience, meaning it should showcase a polished, representative segment of the final game. The gameplay length should be approximately **5 minutes**, providing enough time to demonstrate the core mechanics, AI behaviors, and overall game flow. This duration allows the team to focus on delivering a high-quality, concise experience that highlights the key features of the game while remaining manageable within the project’s timeframe.

Consider the following when designing the gameplay:
- **Core Mechanics**: Ensure that the primary gameplay elements are clearly presented and easy to understand within the 5-minute window.
- **Engagement**: The gameplay should be engaging and provide a clear sense of progression or challenge within the short duration.
- **Replayability**: Although the main experience is 5 minutes, consider adding elements that encourage replayability, such as different outcomes or procedural variation on challenges.

This approach allows for a focused development process and helps ensure that the final product is both polished and representative of the team's vision.

### File Size

When preparing the game for each milestone, especially for the final release on itch.io, teams need to be mindful of the platform's file size limitations. Itch.io has a file size cap for uploads, which is typically 1 GB for free accounts. To ensure your game fits within this limit:

- **Optimize Assets**: Use appropriate compression techniques for textures, audio, and video files to minimize file size without sacrificing quality.
- **Reduce Unnecessary Content**: Remove any unused or placeholder assets from the build to avoid bloating the file size.
- **Test Archive Sizes**: Regularly check the size of your .zip archives to ensure they remain under the 1 GB limit. If your file size exceeds this cap, consider further optimizations or splitting content.
