# Unreal Engine Assignment: AI Implementation in a Genre of Choice

## Premise
In this assignment, students will collaborate in groups to develop a game using Unreal Engine 5. The genre of the game is entirely up to the students, allowing for creative freedom. However, there is a mandatory technical requirement: the implementation of AI using Unreal Engine’s Behavior Tree and Blackboard systems. The AI could be applied in various ways, such as creating enemy behaviors, NPC idle routines, or other AI-driven gameplay mechanics.

This 4-week assignment marks the beginning of the course "Spelprojekt 2 och Portfoliogranskning" and serves as the foundational project. In the later stages of the course, students will continue building upon the skills and knowledge gained during this assignment, with a focus on expanding their portfolio and preparing for professional game development roles. This course is designed to simulate a real-world, industry-like environment, providing students with the opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge in a practical setting through collaborative, project-based learning.


## Technical Requirement: AI Implementation
Each project must include AI elements using Unreal Engine’s Behavior Tree and Blackboard systems. Here are a few examples of how AI can be implemented:

- **Enemy AI**: Create several enemy types with varying behaviors, such as patrolling, attacking, and defending.
- **NPC Routines**: Develop NPCs with idle walking routines, interaction triggers, or reaction systems.
- **Companion AI**: Implement a companion character that follows and assists the player, adapting to different scenarios.
- **Boss AI**: Design a complex AI for a boss character that changes tactics based on the player's actions.

#### File Size Considerations

When preparing the game for each milestone, especially for the final release on itch.io, teams need to be mindful of the platform's file size limitations. Itch.io has a file size cap for uploads, which is typically 1 GB for free accounts. To ensure your game fits within this limit:

- **Optimize Assets**: Use appropriate compression techniques for textures, audio, and video files to minimize file size without sacrificing quality.
- **Reduce Unnecessary Content**: Remove any unused or placeholder assets from the build to avoid bloating the file size.
- **Test Archive Sizes**: Regularly check the size of your .zip archives to ensure they remain under the 1 GB limit. If your file size exceeds this cap, consider further optimizations or splitting content.

By managing your file size effectively, you can avoid issues during the final upload to itch.io and ensure a smooth distribution process.

## Course Structure
