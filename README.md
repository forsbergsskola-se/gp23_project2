# Unreal Engine Assignment: AI Implementation in a Genre of Choice

## Premise
In this assignment, students will collaborate in groups to develop a game using Unreal Engine 5. The genre of the game is entirely up to the students, allowing for creative freedom. However, there is a mandatory technical requirement: the implementation of AI using Unreal Engine’s Behavior Tree and Blackboard systems. The AI could be applied in various ways, such as creating enemy behaviors, NPC idle routines, or other AI-driven gameplay mechanics.

## Technical Requirement: AI Implementation
Each project must include AI elements using Unreal Engine’s Behavior Tree and Blackboard systems. Here are a few examples of how AI can be implemented:

- **Enemy AI**: Create several enemy types with varying behaviors, such as patrolling, attacking, and defending.
- **NPC Routines**: Develop NPCs with idle walking routines, interaction triggers, or reaction systems.
- **Companion AI**: Implement a companion character that follows and assists the player, adapting to different scenarios.
- **Boss AI**: Design a complex AI for a boss character that changes tactics based on the player's actions.

## Course Goals and Learning Outcomes
### Knowledge:
- Understand and apply the workflows of a game project.
- Recognize resource and time constraints within a game project.
- Understand the delineation between different disciplines within a game project.
- Apply agile methodologies in game development.
- Present a game demo effectively in a portfolio.

### Skills:
- Write efficient and functional code for a game project in Unreal Engine.
- Collaborate effectively with other disciplines in project work.

### Competencies:
- Work collaboratively with other disciplines to plan and execute a game project according to a given brief.
- Reflect on the role and responsibilities of a Game Programmer within a project team.
- Demonstrate the ability to work within game a production using state of the art game engine (AA- and AAA-level games)

## Project Structure
### Group Formation
- **Group Size**: 4 students per group.
- **Collaboration**: Each group is responsible for conceptualizing, planning, developing, and presenting a fully functional game project.
- **Agile Methodology**: Groups will implement agile practices such as sprint planning and daily standups. Game reviews will be held every Friday with the mentor to assess progress and make necessary adjustments.

### Deliverables
The deliverables for this project are identical to those of the previous mobile game project:

- **Group Deliverables**:
  - **Functional Game Prototype**: A complete and playable game that incorporates the required AI elements.
  - **PC Build (.exe)**: The game must be packaged into an executable (.exe) file.
  - **Archiving**: The packaged game must be archived into a .zip file (recommended: 7-zip).
  - **Distribution via itch.io**: The archived game must be uploaded to itch.io. The latest release date is on the last date of the course at 09:00 am. Recommendation is therefore to upload the day before.
  - **README.md**: A document detailing the game concept, mechanics, AI implementation, and other relevant information.
- **Presentation of the game including Screenshots/Video**: Visual presentation of the game, highlighting key features and gameplay. On the jury day (last day of the course), each group will present their game in front of a jury joining via Discord.
  - **Working Agreement**: A document outlining the roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each group member.

- **Weekly Sprint Retro Documentation**:
  - **Problems Analyzed**: A list of issues encountered during the sprint.
  - **Actions for Next Sprint**: A list of steps to be taken in the upcoming sprint to address any issues or challenges.
  - **Weekly Routines**:
    - **Monday Sprint Retrospective and Planning**: Every Monday before noon, the team will gather to conduct a sprint retrospective on the previous week's sprint, analyzing what went well, what could be improved, and identifying any problems. This session will also include planning for the upcoming week, setting goals, and determining tasks for each team member.
    - **Daily Scrum**: Each day, the team must conduct a daily scrum meeting, with each student present. During the daily scrum, each member will briefly discuss what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and any blockers or challenges they are facing.
    - **Friday Weekly Review with Kevin**: Every Friday, the team will have a weekly review meeting with Kevin. During this session, the team will present their progress, receive feedback, and brainstorm potential tasks and improvements for the following week.

- **Individual Deliverables**:
  - **Post Mortem**: A reflective report (at least 500 words, recommended 1000) detailing the student's contributions, successes, challenges, and learnings.

### Working Agreement

Each group must create a **Working Agreement**. This document outlines the roles, responsibilities, and expectations for team members. It guides how the team will collaborate and ensures clear communication.

#### Purpose
- **Define Roles**: Clarify each team member's role and responsibilities.
- **Set Expectations**: Establish how the team will communicate, make decisions, and resolve conflicts.
- **Align Goals**: Ensure all team members understand and commit to the project goals.
- **Facilitate Accountability**: Provide a framework for holding team members accountable.

#### Components
1. **Team Roles**: Define roles and responsibilities.
2. **Communication Plan**: Outline how the team will communicate.
3. **Decision-Making**: Describe the process for making decisions.
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Set guidelines for resolving conflicts.
5. **Milestones**: List key project milestones and deadlines.
6. **Accountability**: Establish procedures for tracking progress.

#### Submission
The Working Agreement should be created by all team members and submitted at the project's start (first day). It can be updated as needed, with the agreement of the entire team.

### Weekly Milestones

| Week | Milestone                          | Objective                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Core Gameplay Loop**             | Develop and present the core gameplay loop. By the end of Week 1, each team should have a basic, functional version of the core gameplay loop. Present on Friday.   |
| 2    | **Expansion and Refinement**       | Expand and refine the gameplay loop. Add new mechanics, refine existing ones, and integrate more complex AI behaviors. Present the expanded gameplay on Friday.    |
| 3    | **Polish**                         | Focus on polishing the game, including fixing bugs, improving performance, and fine-tuning AI. Present the polished version during the Friday review session.       |
| 4    | **Release**                        | Finalize and release the game. Package the game as an .exe, archive in a .zip file, and upload to itch.io. Present the final game to a jury via Discord on Friday. |

### Milestone Deliverables

For each weekly milestone, the group is required to present a packaged version of their game. The game should be packaged in **"Shipping Mode"** to ensure optimal performance and to simulate a final release environment. This will allow the team to test and showcase the game in a near-final state at each stage of development.
